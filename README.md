MyCppJourney
Welcome to my C++ learning journey! 💻✨
This repository will contain all the codes I will write  while learning C++ from scratch to advanced. I am following the YouTube playlist "College Wala" and practicing everything hands-on.

📖 My Programming Story
I started learning programming when I came in University standard 🏫, and C++ is  my first programming language. I am completing  the entire Code with College Wala playlist, which will help me in buiding a strong foundation in programming concepts.

When I joined Mehran University of Engineering and Technology 🏛 in the Software Engineering department, I started learning C++ because my first-year, first-semester subject, Programming Fundamentals, focuses on C++. This gave me a chance to visit concepts and strengthen my foundation.

C++ is my first programming language, and I chose it because it is the mother of all programming languages. Learning C++ first gives a solid foundation that makes learning other languages like Python 🐍, Java ☕, and more much easier in the future.

📚 With the time .......
📚 What you will find in this repository:
✅ Basics: Variables, operators, loops, conditional statements
✅ Functions & Recursion
✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Constructors, Destructors
✅ Dynamic Memory Allocation
✅ File Handling
✅ Templates & Function Templates
✅ Standard Template Library (STL): Vectors, Sets, Maps, Stacks, Queues, Deques, Algorithms
✅ Function Objects (Functors)
✅ Advanced topics: Virtual functions, Abstract classes, Runtime Polymorphism
💡 Why this repository is important:
Starting with C++ builds a solid programming foundation. Understanding memory management, pointers, OOP, and advanced C++ features early on makes learning other programming languages much faster and smoother.

This repo is organized sequentially, from beginner-friendly code like Hello World 👋 to advanced C++ concepts. Perfect for anyone who wants to learn C++ the right way, step by step!

🌟 Fun Fact:
C++ is not just a language; it’s a superpower for developers! 💪 Learning it first gives you control over memory, performance, and system-level programming, which most high-level languages abstract away.

Happy coding! 🚀
